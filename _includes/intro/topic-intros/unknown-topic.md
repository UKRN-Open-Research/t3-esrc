Open Research training aims to helps researchers produce practical changes to their everyday workflow to make their research more open, transparent, and robust.
This Train-the-Trainer course will support doctoral training programme staff to lead workshops teaching researchers how to integrate these practices into their existing workflow.


The key components of the UKRN Open Research Training ethos are:
<details>
  <summary>Researchers teaching researchers</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Researchers know the ins and outs of how open research practices work in their field, and they can offer specific, practical guidance to colleagues.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>No homework</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Researchers are busy, so we aim to have the result of the training - a workshop to deliver or an adjusted workflow - in place by the end of the training.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary title="...and good is better!">Better is good</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We want to encourage researchers to do a little more to make their research open, transparent, and robust; we're not trying to admonish researchers for falling short of perfect.
    </li>
  </ul>
</details>
<details>
  <summary>Building connections</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We want to connect researchers keen on open research practices across disciplines and institutions.
    </li>
    <li>
      We want to connect researchers with existing support, especially library services, who can assist with many open research practices.
    </li>
  </ul>

This short course will provide some inspiration about ways to engage your colleagues, and some tips on how to run a successful workshop.
Alongside your co-attendees, you'll design small sections of content that can be woven together into your teaching.

We'll be right here the whole time to answer questions, discuss ideas, and solve any technical issues.
