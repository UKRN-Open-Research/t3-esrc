## UKRN Open Research Training

You're here to get involved in helping your colleagues share their data and research more widely.
We'll cover the basics of Open Access publishing and Data Sharing.

> ## Approach
> * **Practical workflow change**: we want to produce actual changes to how people work by tweaking their default workflow
> * **No homework** for busy researchers
> * **Better is good** - we want everyone doing something a bit better by the end

### Course structure

Today we'll start with introductions to open access publishing and data sharing.
We'll think about some concerns people might have, or questions people might ask about those.
We'll think about what content a workshop on open access might cover
and how it will meet your colleagues' needs.

We'll be giving you some tips on how to deliver workshops,
courtesy of our guest-presenter Louise from Bristol Institute of Teaching and Learning.
At the end, there will be a block of time for you to apply Louise's techniques to
a small portion of a workshop, producing between you a list of resources you can use
in designing and delivering your own workshops.

> ## What you'll get out of this course
> * A collection of resources you can use to teach colleagues about sharing data and research
> * Some ideas for how to engage colleagues and manage a workshop
> * Membership of an enthusiastic community of like-minded researchers in various disciplines
