It's time to try to apply what we learned earlier in Louise's session to our own workshops.
You probably already chose a topic earlier today, but in case you missed it,
the list of suggested topics is in the
<a href="{{ site.collaborative_notes }}" target="_blank">collaborative notes document</a>.
If you put your name beside the topic you want to cover we'll be able to ensure that everyone
takes a different topic.
When we share the outcomes at the end, hopefully we'll have a large chunk of your workshop
already planned out with engaging activities -- many hands make light work.

> ## Write learning objectives `5 min`
> Based on Bloom’s taxonomy, write roughly 2-5 learning objectives for your lesson topic.
> Remember to keep the audience in mind (who are your learners?)
{: .discussion}

> ## Brainstorm and choose an exercise (or two) for teaching that topic `10 min`
> Think about what you want the exercise to achieve:
> - Check progress?
> - Get people engaged?
> - Get attendees to try something for themselves?
>
> Think about what exercises will work best with your logistical constraints:
> - Time
> - Format (online or in person)
> - Number of attendees
> - Who attendees are (career stage, etc.)
{: .discussion}

> ## Write a brief plan of how the lesson will go (plan A and plan B, C etc.) `20 min`
> ### Plan A
> - Write out your lesson plan - what content and activities
> - Assign timings
> - Decide the order to do things
> - Who will deliver? (e.g. you, someone else, will you need helpers?)
>
> ### Contingencies - consider possible problems and whether/how they should be addressed
> - What if there are technical problems?
> - What if no one says anything?
> - What if they don’t say one of the key things?
> - What if discussion goes off topic?
> - What else is likely to go ‘wrong’?
{: .discussion}

> ## Share `10 min`
> In pairs (or with the whole group if there's time) share what you've come up with.
> Do your contingencies cover enough to leave you feeling confident that you can handle
> whatever comes up?
> Can you think of improvements at this stage?
{: .discussion}
