The <a href="{{ site.ukrn_or_browser }}" target="_blank">Open Research Resource Browser</a> is a tool that reads and filters a Google Sheets document we have created (and to which you can contribute) which lists open research resources.

You should find the Browser intuitive to use, but ask if you're not sure.

> ## Can you... `10 min`
> 1. Find the ESRC's research data policy
> 2. Filter for Social Sciences resources
> 3. Find the text resources which mention 'metadata' in their description
{: .challenge}

The spreadsheet the resources are taken from is <a href="{{ site.ukrn_or_resources }}" target="_blank">available to view</a> and we welcome suggestions for additional contributions.
Contributions can be added and available instantly, so just ask us to add something if you think others might benefit from it.
